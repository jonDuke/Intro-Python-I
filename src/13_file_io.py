"""
Python makes performing file I/O simple. Take a look
at how to read and write to files here:

"""

# Open up the "foo.txt" file (which already exists) for reading
# Print all the contents of the file, then close the file
# Note: pay close attention to your current directory when trying to open "foo.txt"

# YOUR CODE HERE
f = open("foo.txt", "r")
print(f.read())
f.close()

# Open up a file called "bar.txt" (which doesn't exist yet) for
# writing. Write three lines of arbitrary content to that file,
# then close the file. Open up "bar.txt" and inspect it to make
# sure that it contains what you expect it to contain

# YOUR CODE HERE
f = open("bar.txt", "w")
f.write("""I had a phone meeting with Ted
Whom it turns out was ill in his bed
He thought it was muted,
And went on and pooted,
To find he'd pushed "speaker" instead.

f.close()
